# Web Visualization Dashboard - Weather vs. Latitude

## Description

This project creates a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I created in [a previous project](https://github.com/angang-li/northwestern-data-science-bootcamp/tree/master/hw6-api). Specifically, [weather data](Resources/cities.csv) were analyzed and plotted.

This dashboard contains the following pages:

* A [landing page](https://angang-li.github.io/weather-visualization/index.html):
  * An explanation of the project.
* Four visualization pages([temperature](https://angang-li.github.io/weather-visualization/visualizations/temp.html), [humidity](https://angang-li.github.io/weather-visualization/visualizations/humidity.html), [cloudiness](https://angang-li.github.io/weather-visualization/visualizations/cloudiness.html), and [wind speed](https://angang-li.github.io/weather-visualization/visualizations/wind-speed.html)):
  * The plot/visualization for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A [comparison page](https://angang-li.github.io/weather-visualization/comparison.html):
  * All of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
* A [data page](https://angang-li.github.io/weather-visualization/data.html):
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

All pages have a navigation menu that links to all other pages. All pages are responsive to various screen sizes (bootstrap, media queries).
